NOTE
----
This is a utility class that is intended to format your WordPress theme menu with the correct syntax and classes to utilize the Twitter Bootstrap dropdown navigation, and does not include the required Bootstrap JS files. You will have to include them manually. 

Installation
------------
Place **wp_bootstrap_navwalker.php** in your WordPress theme folder `/wp-content/your-theme/`

Open your WordPress themes **functions.php** file  `/wp-content/your-theme/functions.php` and add the following code:

```php
// Register Custom Navigation Walker
require_once('wp_bootstrap_navwalker.php');
```

Usage
------------
Update your `wp_nav_menu()` function to use the new walker by adding a "walker" item to the wp_nav_menu array.

```php
<?php 
	wp_nav_menu( array(
		'menu'		 => 'top_menu',
		'depth'		 => 2,
		'container'	 => false,
		'menu_class' => 'nav',
		'fallback_cb' => 'wp_page_menu',
		//Process nav menu using our custom nav walker
		'walker' => new wp_bootstrap_navwalker())
	);
?>
```

Your menu will now be formatted with the correct syntax and classes to implement Twitter Bootstrap dropdown navigation. 

To change your menu style add Bootstrap nav class names to the `menu_class` declaration.

```php
<?php 
	wp_nav_menu( array(
		'menu'		 => 'side_menu',
		'depth'		 => 1,
		'container'	 => false,
		'menu_class' => 'nav nav-tabs nav-stacked',
		'fallback_cb' => 'wp_page_menu',
		//Process nav menu using our custom nav walker
		'walker' => new wp_bootstrap_navwalker())
	);
?>
```

Extras

This script included the ability to add Bootstrap dividers and Nav Headers to your menus through the WordPress menu UI. 

######Icons
To add an Icon to your link simple place the full Glyphicon class name in the links **Title Attribute** field and the class will do the rest.

######Dividers
Simply add a Link menu item with a **URL** of `#` and a **Link Text** of `divider` (case-insensitive so ‘divider’ or ‘Divider’ will both work ) and the class will do the rest.

![Divider Example](http://edwardmcintyre.com/pub/github/navwalker-divider.jpg)

You can also add a vertical divider by adding a Link menu item with a **URL** of `#` and a **Link Text** of `divider-vertical`

######Navigation Headers
Adding a navigation header is very similar, add a new link with a **URL** of `#` and a **Link Text** of `nav-header` (it matches the Bootstrap CSS class so it's easy to remember). When the item is added use the **Title Attribute** field to set your header text and the class will do the rest.
